This addon extends the **FullCalendar for Flow** addon with the **FullCalendar Scheduler**, which provides
additional resource based views (Timeline View and Vertical Resource View) for Vaadin 14+.

It is based on the latest version of the FullCalendar Scheduler library 6.x.

It needs the [basic addon](https://github.com/stefanuebe/vaadin_fullcalendar/wiki/FullCalendar) to work.
Since this addon is not always updated when the basis gets an update, I suggest, that you add both dependencies
(basis and extension) to always use the latest versions. This extension is compatible as long as the readme
does not tells anything else.

## Requirements / versions / support
The addon is built against Vaadin 14.x and Java 8, but is intended to be used with the latest major Vaadin version
and thus also supports Vaadin 23 and 24 / Java 11+.

Addon versions prior to the current major version are not supported anymore. If you need a fix for such a version
feel free to fork the project. You may create an issue, but due to limited time it is very unlikely, that we will fix
it.

Please also have a look at the demo for some basic examples and source code of how to integrate the FC.
