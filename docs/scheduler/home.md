This addon extends the **FullCalendar for Flow** addon with the **FullCalendar Scheduler**, which provides
additional resource based views (Timeline View and Vertical Resource View) for Vaadin 23+.

It is based on the latest version of the FullCalendar Scheduler library 6.x. For Vaadin 14-22, please use 4.x.

It needs the [basic addon](https://github.com/stefanuebe/vaadin_fullcalendar/wiki/FullCalendar) to work.
Since this addon is not always updated when the basis gets an update, I suggest, that you add both dependencies
(basis and extension) to always use the latest versions. This extension is compatible as long as the readme
does not tells anything else.

**Note** Any version prior to the current major version is not supported anymore. If you need a fix for such a version
feel free to fork the project. You may create an issue, but due to limited time it is very unlikely, that we will fix
it.
