This addon extends the **FullCalendar for Flow** addon with the **FullCalendar Scheduler**, which provides
additional resource based views (Timeline View and Vertical Resource View) for Vaadin 14+.

It needs the [basic addon](https://github.com/stefanuebe/vaadin_fullcalendar/wiki/FullCalendar) to work.
Since this addon is not always updated when the basis gets an update, I suggest, that you add both dependencies
(basis and extension) to always use the latest versions. This extension is compatible as long as the readme
does not tells anything else.

**Versions**:

- **3.x.x**: Uses FullCalendar 5.x.x.
- **2.x.x**: Uses FullCalendar 4.x.x. **Will only receive maintenance fixes.**

For a Vaadin 10-13 version (that is built on FC 3.10.x), see https://vaadin.com/directory/component/full-calendar-scheduler-extension-vaadin10
