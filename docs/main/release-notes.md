# 6.2.x
[Details](https://github.com/stefanuebe/vaadin_fullcalendar/wiki/Release-Notes-6.2.x)
- added custom native event handlers for entries

# 6.1.x
[Details](https://github.com/stefanuebe/vaadin_fullcalendar/wiki/Release-Notes-6.1.x)
- added an optional Lumo theme for the addon

# 6.0.x
- updated to FullCalendar 6.1.6
- Migrated from Polymer 3 to simple HTML Element based web component (no Lit nor Polymer)
- Migrated source code from JavaScript to TypeScript (ongoing process, not yet finished)
- Folder structures changed
- Tag names prefixed with "vaadin-"
- Content is now part of the light dom, thus styling will be easier
- Client side eager loading removed, items will now always be fetched
- Added prefetch mode to allow smoother transition between periods
- Breaking changes regarding methods and fields (client side and server side). Also usage of private / protected modifiers in TS.
- Added support for FC's "multi-month" views.
- Added proper API for creating and registering custom views. Also added an internal handling of "anonymous" custom views created by initial options.
- Deprecated code from previous versions has been removed
- JsonItem has been removed, Entry is a "normal field" class again due to issues with proxying frameworks
- setHeight has been minimalized to be more aligned with Vaadin standards. FC internal height settings / options are not
  supported anymore. Calendar content will take only as much space as needed.
- added type `RecurringTime` to allow setting an entry recurrence of more than 24h


Minor changes:
- getResources now may return null. Use getOrCreateResources.
- CalendarLocale is now an enum. Use getLocale() to obtain the contained locale value.
- week numbers within days is no longer available, weeknumbers are now always display inside days.
- RenderingMode and alike namings have been named to DisplayMode / display to match the FC library naming. Also DisplayMode is now a top level class.
- added resize observer to client side to automatically take care of resizes
- added our own @NotNull annotation to allow support for Vaadin 23 and 24
- Entry's method `copy(Class<T>)` has been renamed to `copyAsType(Class<T>)`.

Other things that we may have overseen :)
