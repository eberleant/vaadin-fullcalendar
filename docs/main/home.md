# FullCalendar web component addon
This addon is an integration of the FullCalendar as a Flow component. It is based on the version 6.1.6 of the 
FullCalendar library.

Please also visit the homepage of the FullCalendar at https://fullcalendar.io/. They did a great job at building the foundation for this addons.

## Requirements / versions / support
The addon is built against Vaadin 14.x and Java 8, but is intended to be used with the latest major Vaadin version
and thus also supports Vaadin 23 and 24 / Java 11+.

Addon versions prior to the current major version are not supported anymore. If you need a fix for such a version
feel free to fork the project. You may create an issue, but due to limited time it is very unlikely, that we will fix
it.

Please also have a look at the demo for some basic examples and source code of how to integrate the FC.
For more examples please have a look into the example section.

## Authors of this addon
This addon is currently maintained by Carlo Zanocco and me. If you have any questions or issues, please
