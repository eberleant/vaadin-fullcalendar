# FullCalendar web component addon
This addon is an integration of the FullCalendar as a Flow component for Vaadin 23+.

It is based on the latest version of the FullCalendar library 6.x. For Vaadin 14-22, please use 4.x.

**Note** Any version prior to the current major version is not supported anymore. If you need a fix for such a version
feel free to fork the project. You may create an issue, but due to limited time it is very unlikely, that we will fix
it.

Please also have a look at the demo for some basic examples and source code of how to integrate the FC.
For more examples please have a look into the example section.
